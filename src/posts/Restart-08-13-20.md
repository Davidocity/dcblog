This post marks the restart of my blog. The previous version started on November 18, 2012. Over the last nearly eight years, I have used it to educate myself on Wordpress and, along the way, to collect interesting quotes and short passages. I wrote a few blog posts too.

The new phase of this blog will mark its transition from the Wordpress CMS to the Eleventy SSG (Static Site Generator). Wordpress remains a great platform but is a bit too much for a simple, self-hosted blog, in my opinion. The primary benefits of SSGs are performance, cost, and simplicity.

I chose Eleventy for my SSG because I found it to be the easiest to use and it performed wonderfully out of the box. My site easily scores at or near 100 on Google's mobile and desktop [PageSpeed Insight](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) test and the cost of hosting it on NearlyFreeSpeech.net is next to nothing because I am merely hosting mostly web pages, not a large CMS and database.

As I explore the world of SSG, I may move to another provider, but Eleventy thus far has proved to be a powerful yet easy to use platform. Capared to Wordpress, Eleventy will require a little more technical knowhow. There are several SSGs from which to choose. Go to [Static Gen](https://www.staticgen.com) to see a fairly comprehensive list of SSG ranked by popularity.
