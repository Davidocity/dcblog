## Now

I am currently on hiatus while reassessing everything in light of the economy and Covid-19. During this period, I have been reacquainting myself with the latest trends in the digital world and taking the time to safely visit the Eastern Sierra in California and other outdoor areas.

### Some trends I am studying:
1. Looking into the world of SSG's (Static Site Generators). For many websites, SSG's offer a major performance improvement over Wordpress and other CMS's. I just moved my DavidCantrell.net site from Wordpress to the Eleventy SSG. Check out how fast this site is using [Google's PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).
2. Also, looking into the new concept of "Connection Marketing," which is an evolution from Content Marketing.
3. Finally, with so much content online and much of it suspect, more and more consumers are relying on trusted curators to help them identify the right content (and stuff to buy) over the crud. I am curious how this might impact the online marketing world.

### On a personal level:
4. I am considering learning JavaScript.
5. I am also considering taking a deep-dive course on Connection Marketing.
6. I am doing my best to enjoy life as much as possible given the current issues in the world.
